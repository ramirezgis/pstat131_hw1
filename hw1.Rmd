Machine Learning Main Ideas

Question 1: Define supervised and unsupervised learning. What are the 
difference(s) between them?
- Supervised learning is predicting or estimating the output based on the inputs added into the model created by the researcher (pg 1 of textbook*). Unsupervised learning on the other hand is having inputs but the researcher does not know the output, aka the response variable. The differences between both types of learning is that the response is known for the supervised learning but not unsupervised and 


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(ISLR)
```



```{r cars}
data(mpg)
hist(mpg$hwy)
```



```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
